# Social Media Posts: FL Build Log Promotion

Here are 6 ready-to-post social media updates for sharing the FL experiment.

## Platform: X (Twitter)

### Option 1: Story Style
I used to think I needed a backend dev to build a dynamic voting app.
Turns out, I just needed AI and LocalStorage.

Today I built a decentralized voting system for FL without a single database. The community votes, the interface reacts instantly. 

See how it works (and steal the code) 👇

### Option 2: Visual/Punchy Style
🚀 FL Update: Day 3
From "Static Page" -> "Community Driven App" in 24 hours.

✅ LocalStorage Voting
✅ Auto-sorting Algorithm
✅ Zero Backend Cost

This is what happens when you let AI handle the heavy lifting.

## Platform: LinkedIn

### Option 3: Problem/Solution Style
How do you build a product roadmap when you have no team and no budget?
My solution: Let the users build it.

I just implemented a "Community Sensing" system for my FL project.
- Users vote on features.
- The highest votes automatically trigger the next development phase.
- No backend required.

It's an experiment in automated growth. Read the technical deep dive here:

### Option 4: Lesson Learned (Story)
"Don't build what you think they want. Build what they ask for."
I took this advice literally.

Today, I shipped a feature that lets visitors control my development queue.
The technical challenge wasn't the code (AI handled that); it was designing a system that works without a server.

Here's how we solved it with simple JavaScript: [Link]

## Platform: Reddit (r/webdev, r/SideProject)

### Option 5: Developer to Developer (Question)
**Title:** I built a "serverless" voting app using only LocalStorage. Am I crazy?

I'm experimenting with a zero-cost stack (HTML/Tailwind/JS). Today I implemented a feature voting system where data persists in the user's browser and "syncs" via social sharing (manual propagation).

It sounds hacky, but it actually creates a cool viral loop.
I wrote a breakdown of the logic here: [Link]

Would love to hear if anyone else has tried this "no-backend" approach for MVP validation?

### Option 6: Visual Summary (Text-based)
**Title:** Case Study: Building a Self-Driving Product Roadmap with AI

I'm documenting my journey building a site from scratch with AI.
**Day 3 Update:**
1. **Problem:** Static sites feel dead.
2. **Solution:** Frontend logic that "listens" to user clicks.
3. **Tech:** JS Filter() + LocalStorage + DOM Injection.

Result: A site that updates its own homepage based on what users want.
